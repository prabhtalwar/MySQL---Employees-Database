# Building an EmployeeÂ Database

* The database consists of several related tables that store information about employees, their departments, titles, and salaries.
* The employees table holds basic employee details, such as first and last names.
* The departments table contains department information, while the dept_emp table links employees to their respective departments.
* The titles table records the various job titles held by employees over time, and the salaries table captures salary information for each employee.

  Together, these tables allow for comprehensive tracking and querying of employee data, including departmental assignments, job titles, and salary history.
